# Overview

These are samples of HEIC (ISO 94416-12 HEIF format) files that have EXIF data. It was non-trivial to find such examples at this point in time, so I'm making them generally available, here.

# Attribution

Apologies. I downloaded these prior to checking them for EXIF, and could not recall where from.
